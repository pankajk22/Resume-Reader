# Resume-Reader

Problem Statement:

Develop a Web-based Resume Reader Application program. The program will take Word or PDF document as an input, read it into a local database, and give the following results:
- Name, Email address and Phone number of the candidate 
- Linkedin profile link 
- Total No. of Text Lines + Total No. of Text characters on each page 
- Which Fonts and which Font Sizes are present in the document 
- How many tables and images are present in the document
After running the application, it should give an option to download the database in .xlsx file or .csv file.
